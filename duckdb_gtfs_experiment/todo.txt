* create tables with proper foreign keys from raw table?
* convert strings to better data types?
* introduce integer-based Ids instead of strings?
* precompute joined tables for relevant methods of `org.opentripplanner.raptor.spi.RaptorTransitDataProvider`

Warning: oltp-style queries need indices or other optimization, e.g.

    select * from stop_times_joined where trip_id = 2405582;

will take almost a second on a laptop....
