## About the experiment

This is a fork of [OTP](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner). 

We want to experiment with using OTP's raptor implementation as a standalone library.

### Step 1: Use RaptorService (API) with simple example

__Goal:__  Execute a few queries on the OTP Raptor API. Try to load timetable data via GTFS import.

__Steps:__

    - [ ] Fork the OTP GH project.

    - [ ] Start with a simple test case (or a few) using the existing RaptorTestCase mechanism but our own scenario.

    - [ ] Possible approach: Get rid of the test support code like RaptorTestCase so that in the end we use RaptorService directly. Alternative: Build RaptorService use up from scratch.

    - [ ] Create time table for our scenario as GTFS files.

    - [ ] Import GTFS files for running the test. Use OTPâ€™s approach or an external library.
